I had project on this dir `/Users/Admin/Documents/project/analisis_kebocoran_dats/analisis_kebocoran_data` that project had couple important dirs or services 
that ran with couple programming languages:
nextjs as frontend
expressjs and golang as backend

communication between frontend and backend using graphql

the nextjs frontend:
location: `/Users/Admin/Documents/project/analisis_kebocoran_dats/analisis_kebocoran_data`

the backends=>
graphql service (using expressjs):
location: /Users/Admin/Documents/project/analisis_kebocoran_dats/analisis_kebocoran_data/graphql_express_server

grpc service (using golang):
location: /Users/Admin/Documents/project/analisis_kebocoran_dats/analisis_kebocoran_data/grpc_go_mongo_server

SSE service (using expressjs)
location: /Users/Admin/Documents/project/analisis_kebocoran_dats/analisis_kebocoran_data/sse_node_server

database I used is mongodb
I want you to analyze just important parts from thoose folders and understand the correlation between them
then create `documentation.txt` file on `/Users/Admin/Documents/project/analisis_kebocoran_dats/analisis_kebocoran_data/docs` write on that doc file
how my codebase works, remember just important parts of code/function

then after that create file `dot_language.txt` on `/Users/Admin/Documents/project/analisis_kebocoran_dats/analisis_kebocoran_data/docs`  based on this documentation `https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html`. 
on that file will explain correlation my codebase cause I want to use graphiz to visualize them
